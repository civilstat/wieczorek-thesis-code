# Create the simulated data used for Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 in thesis:
# specifically, the KnownK simulations at the smaller n = 50, 250, 1250,
# for K=5, p=50 and 250, as well as some other settings not used in final thesis.

# Unfortunately, I didn't set a seed or datafile suffix when I ran this;
# but this script was how I generated SimData_16-07-19.R



# 4 sims at nCores=6 took 24.5/3 sec,
# so 1200 sims should take 2450 sec = 40 min
# Starting around 2:40pm July 19,
# expect to finish 3:30pm Jul 19.

# Rerun (almost) same settings as 16-06-22 sims,
# but with KNOWN true value of K.
# Basically, freq of finding true model
# will just tell us how often FS find the right model *path*
# separately from how often CV chooses the right K.
# This will let us calibrate how often
# each algorithm's mistakes are due to bad K, vs to bad model path.

# Because of how the multiple-sim code is structured,
# easiest if we just run all 3 procedures (fixed K values)
# on every data setting, then drop the "wrong K" procedures afterwards.
# So this wastes computation (3x as long as needed),
# but ought to run fast enough that this won't be major issue,
# since not doing any CV.

# ALSO, drop the high betamin setting,
# since we found it's equiv to using high n on low betamin.
# And drop muFactor = 1/5 setting, since equiv to muFactor = 1.


# Keep doNormalize = FALSE from now on.
# Also still keeping fixed for now:
# Sigma = ConstCorr, epsilon ~ Normal,
# voting across splits instead of avg'ing testRSS.

# Compare data settings:
# K = 3, 5, 10
# p = 11, 50, 250
# n = 50, 250, 1250
# mu = 1/(2K) * [1, 5]
# beta_min = 1/5
#
# and use just the FS alg variants
# FS_KnownK
# with each K = 3, 5, 10
