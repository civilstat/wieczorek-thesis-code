# Create the simulated data used for Figure 6.4 in thesis:
# specifically, the simulations at the largest n=6250.



# 5 sims at nCores=6 took 430+23=453 sec,
# so 100 sims should take 9060 sec = 151 min,
# so let's do 1000 sims in 25.5 hrs.
# Starting on hydra2 around 3:35pm Sept 24,
# expect to finish by 5pm Sept 25.

# Repeating 17-09-14 "small n" with "bad" t2 noise,
# but now adding the largest n=6250.
# 
# Running
# (SeqCVa vs FullCVa) x (1S vs VF),
# at 3 train:test ratios (4:1, 1:1, and 1:4).
# Also add KnownK,
# all at several combos of n, mu, k, p.


mySeed = 170924 # actually running on Sept 24 not 14
mySuffix = "17-09-14_LargeN"

# Keep doNormalize = FALSE.

# Use data settings:
# Sigma = ConstCorr
# K = 3,5,10
# p = 11,50,250
# n = 6250
# mu = 1/(2K) * [1, 5]
# beta_min = 1/5
# epsilon ~ t2
#
# and use either 1S or 5F CV-a variants, with Seq vs Full CV,
# at train/test ratios 4:1, 1:1, and 1:4.
# Also KnownK with K=3,5,10
# (run separately, so we can tailor the alg to K)
