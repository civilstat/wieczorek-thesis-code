# Create the simulated data used for Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 in thesis:
# specifically, the KnownK simulations at the largest n = 6250,
# for K=5, p=50 and 250, as well as some other settings not used in final thesis.



# 5 sims at nCores=6 took 8 sec,
# so 1000 sims should take 1600 sec = 27 min
# Starting around 2:30pm Sept 9,
# expect to finish 3pm Sept 9.

# We need to supplement the KnownK sims from 16-07-19 and 16-07-20,
# just for extra-large n, at every combo of K, p, and muFactor.
# THIS SCRIPT just does K=5 at muFactor=1,5.
# The other two scripts today do K=3 and then K=10,
# at each of muFactor=1,5.

mySeed = 1709105
mySuffix = "17-09-10_K5"

# Keep doNormalize = FALSE from now on.
# Also still keeping fixed for now:
# Sigma = ConstCorr, epsilon ~ Normal,
# voting across splits instead of avg'ing testRSS.

# Compare data settings:
# K = 5
# p = 11, 50, 250
# n = 6250
# mu = 1/(2K) * [1, 5]
# beta_min = 1/5
#
# and use just the FS alg variants
# FS_KnownK
# with K = 5
