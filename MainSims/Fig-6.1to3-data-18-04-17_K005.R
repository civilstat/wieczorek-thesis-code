# Create the simulated data used for Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 in thesis:
# specifically, the known-K AND estimated-K simulations for K=5,
# at every n = 50, 250, 1250, 6250,
# at the p = 10 and 1250 not already simulated for K=5.



# 4 sims at nCores=6 took 5720 sec,
# so 400? sims should take 572000 sec = 9530 min = 159 hrs = 6.6 days.
# (1000 sims' precision may be higher than we really need.)
# Repeating 18-04-14, but doing all 400 sims at once.
# Hope to have 160hrs from 5:30pm Tues --> 9:30am Tues:
# Starting on hydra5 around 5:30pm Tues April 17,
# expect to finish by 9:30am Tues April 24.

# Running JUST K=5, p=(10,1250) combos of the below sims,
# since we have the other p settings for K=5 already.

# Running
# SeqCVa VF vs FullCVa VF,
# at 2 train:test ratios (4:1 and 1:4).
# Also add KnownK,
# all at several combos of n, mu, k, p.
# Aiming for especially large k and p:
# k = 5, 25, 125,
# p = 10, 50, 250, 1250...
# REMEMBER to drop all combinations where k>p or k>n

mySeed = 180417.005
mySuffix = "18-04-17_K005"


# Keep doNormalize = FALSE.

# Use data settings:
# Sigma = ConstCorr
# K = 5
# p = 10, 1250
# n = 50, 250, 1250, 6250
# mu = 1/(2K), 5/(2K)
# beta_min = 1/5
# epsilon ~ N(0,1)
#
# and use 5F CV-a variants, with Seq CV and FullCV,
# at train/test ratios 4:1 and 1:4.
# Also KnownK with K=5
