# Create the simulated data used for Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 in thesis:
# specifically, the known-K AND estimated-K simulations for K=125,
# at every n = 50, 250, 1250, 6250,
# at every p = 10, 50, 250, 1250.



# 4 sims at nCores=6 took 6540 sec,
# so 400 sims should take 654000 sec = 10900 min = 182 hrs = 7.6 days.
# (1000 sims' precision may be higher than we really need.)
# Starting on hydra2 around 1pm Sat April 14,
# expect to finish by 3am Sun April 22.

# Running JUST K=125 combos of the below sims

# Running
# SeqCVa VF vs FullCVa VF,
# at 2 train:test ratios (4:1 and 1:4).
# Also add KnownK,
# all at several combos of n, mu, k, p.
# Aiming for especially large k and p:
# k = 5, 25, 125,
# p = 10, 50, 250, 1250...
# REMEMBER to drop all combinations where k>p or k>n

mySeed = 180414.125
mySuffix = "18-04-14_K125"


# Keep doNormalize = FALSE.

# Use data settings:
# Sigma = ConstCorr
# K = 125
# p = 10, 50, 250, 1250
# n = 50, 250, 1250, 6250
# mu = 1/(2K), 5/(2K)
# beta_min = 1/5
# epsilon ~ N(0,1)
#
# and use 5F CV-a variants, with Seq CV and FullCV,
# at train/test ratios 4:1 and 1:4.
# Also KnownK with K=125
