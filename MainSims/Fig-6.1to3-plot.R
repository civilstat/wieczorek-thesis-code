# Recreate Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 from thesis

# Data-generating scripts are a bit messy,
# because they were run at different times,
# and I cobbled together the relevant results from several different runs
# for the final graphs in the thesis.
# In summary...

# 16-07-19 and 17-09-10_K5:
#   for smaller n (50, 250, 1250) or largest n (6250) respectively,
#   these are results for oracle FS with *known* K,
#   for K=5 and p=50 or 250,
#   from an earlier phase when we had other K and p settings not used in final thesis.
# 17-09-09_SmallN and 17-09-09_LargeN:
#   for smaller n (50, 250, 1250) or largest n (6250) respectively,
#   these are results for FS *estimating* K,
#   for K=5 and p=50 or 250,
#   from an earlier phase when we had other K and p settings not used in final thesis.
# 18-04-17_K005, 18-04-14_K025, and 18-04-14_K125:
#   for K = 5, 25, or 125 respectively,
#   these are results for FS with both *known* and *estimated* K,
#   at all n (50, 250, 1250, 6250) and at the newer p = 10, 1250 settings,
#   as well as the older p = 50, 250 settings for the newer K = 25, 125.

# Taken together, these 7 files generated the results for...
#   known K vs estimated K,
#   K = 5, 25, 125,
#   n = 50, 250, 1250, 6250,
#   p = 10, 50, 250.

# (For future papers based on this work,
# might be worthwhile to redo 18-04-17_K005 run at *all* settings of p,
# so we only need the equivalent of those three 18-04-1*_K*** files
# rather than the 7 files we have here.)
