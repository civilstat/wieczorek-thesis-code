# Create the simulated data used for Figure 6.5 in thesis



# 5 sims at nCores=6 took 11 sec,
# so 100 sims should take 220 sec = 4 min,
# so let's do 1000 sims in 37 min.
# Starting on hydra4 around 2:15pm Sept 25,
# expect to finish by 3pm Sept 25.

# Using "bad" Sigma, specifically the special case (K=10, p=11)
# where we saw a clear difference between good and bad.
# 
# Running
# (SeqCVa vs FullCVa) x (1S vs VF),
# at 3 train:test ratios (4:1, 1:1, and 1:4).
# Also add KnownK,
# all at several combos of n, mu,
# but setting k=10, p=11.

# Keep doNormalize = FALSE.

# Use data settings:
# Sigma = Sigma.NegKPosOthers with SigmaApprox = FALSE,
# K = 10
# p = 11
# n = 50,250,1250,6250
# mu = 1/(2K) * [1, 1.9]
# beta_min = 1/5
# epsilon ~ N(0,1)
#
# and use either 1S or 5F CV-a variants, with Seq vs Full CV,
# at train/test ratios 4:1, 1:1, and 1:4.
# Also KnownK with K=10
