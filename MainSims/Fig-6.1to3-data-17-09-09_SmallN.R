# Create the simulated data used for Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 in thesis:
# specifically, the estimated-K simulations at the smaller n = 50, 250, 1250,
# for K=5, p=50 and 250, as well as some other settings not used in final thesis.



# 5 sims at nCores=6 took 193 sec,
# so 100 sims should take 3860 sec = 65 min,
# so let's do 1000 sims in 10.5 hrs.
# Starting on hydra2 around 2:10pm Sept 8,
# expect to finish by 1am Sept 9.

# Following on 17-09-08 test,
# do a full run now:
# (SeqCVa vs FullCVa) x (1S vs VF),
# at 3 train:test ratios (4:1, 1:1, and 1:4),
# plus KnownK,
# all at several combos of n, mu, k, p.
# 
# But splitting it up into several runs:
# one for all the settings with n=6250, and
# another for all the remaining settings, and
# a third for KnownK.
#
# THIS SCRIPT, SmallN, is for the "other n, CV" settings.

mySeed = 170909
mySuffix = "17-09-09_SmallN"


# Keep doNormalize = FALSE,
# Sigma = ConstCorr.

# Use data settings:
# K = 3,5,10
# p = 11,50,250
# n = 50,250,1250
# mu = 1/(2K) * [1, 5]
# beta_min = 1/5
# epsilon ~ Normal
#
# and use either 1S or 5F CV-a variants, with Seq vs Full CV,
# at train/test ratios 4:1, 1:1, and 1:4.
