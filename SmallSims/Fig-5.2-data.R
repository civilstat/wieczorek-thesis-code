# Create the simulated data used for Figure 5.2 in thesis


#### SIMULATE ####

## * P(overfit) and P(underfit) vs n_c/n, at various SNRs,
##   at least for a correct fixed path;
##   note that the theory (from Zhang) assumes multiple-folds CV-a,
##   so we're using 20 reps of multifold / MC-CV

## k=5, p=6: ran for 4223 sec = 70 min
## k=10, p=11: ran for 8637 sec = 144 min

  M = 600 # nr datasets to generate, so MOEs are +/- 0.02
  B = 20 # nr reps of CV per dataset
  ## last year, sims showed it's stable by 20 folds / CV rep,
  ## but maybe that's not as true for very high ratios, nearly LOO?
  
  ratios = 1:19/20 ## Try at train:test ratios from 0.05 to 0.95

  ## Orig. tried SNRs around 20, 40, 80, but 40 and 80 looked identical,
  ## and all were pretty low except for the smallest ratios,
  ## so let's try some lower SNRs too
